# conveyor_blend
Model describing the conveyor blend dynamics related to blending the materials

## Main objectives
1. replicate the material positioning in conveyor belt during the discharge of a series of silos
    1. This part was implemented in folder functional files 
3. Calculate the outcome of several recipes of blending in stock_house
4. Model several checks, for conveyor integrity, volume of material, etc
5. Model Charging Capacity, and creating also cycle diagrams, considering several types of top charging systems


## Future Capabilities - Next Steps
1. Capacity to generate an config file (JSON) to use it as an easy way to get an base setup and share with other people
2. Capacity to generate basic reports in PDF or word files.
3. Generate an general cycle diagram to shows to the client the charging capacity.
    
## Actual Stage 
generates graphs of % of each material in conveyor belt, starts and end of each silo and flow in conveyor. 
Is possible to configurate tables for silos and materials
and set simple variables in the system.
